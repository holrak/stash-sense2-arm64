"""Local performer index sync as a queue job.

Builds/updates a usearch index from this Stash instance's own performer
cover images (see local_performer_index.py), diffed against the index's
own persisted JSON mapping -- no separate SQL tracking table needed, the
mapping file already records each performer's last-synced image content
hash. Every performer with a real (non-placeholder) cover gets its image
fetched and hash-compared each run; only ones whose bytes actually
changed pay for face detection + embedding. A URL-based shortcut to skip
the fetch too was tried and reverted -- Stash's image URL cache-busting
param tracks updated_at, which changes on *any* field edit, not just an
image swap, so it couldn't tell "nothing changed" from "renamed."

The one bulk `get_all_performers()` call in `run()` already returns every
field (image_path, stash_ids, name) that a per-performer GraphQL query
would -- `_fetch_one()` uses that directly rather than re-fetching each
performer individually. That per-performer re-fetch used to go through
the shared RateLimiter that guards the local Stash instance's API (5
req/sec by default) on every one of them -- confirmed live, that alone
turned a run over ~1600 already-unchanged performers into 5+ minutes,
regardless of FETCH_CONCURRENCY, since the limiter serializes across all
concurrent fetches. The image download itself bypasses that GraphQL
client/rate limiter entirely (a plain httpx call), so removing the
redundant re-fetch leaves this job bound only by that.

A performer with no custom cover image still returns an image_path, but
Stash marks it with a "default=true" query param -- that's how "no image
yet" is detected, without needing to fetch and fail to decode a
placeholder icon.

## Concurrency

Fetch (network) is async with bounded concurrency, sharing one
httpx.AsyncClient; detect+embed (CPU-bound) runs on a small pool of real
worker threads, each its own FaceEmbeddingGenerator -- same split as
stash-sense2-data-gen's build/backfill_genderage.py, and for the same
reason (fetches are I/O-bound, detection is CPU-bound around each ONNX
call). Kept far more modest than that backfill's 32/5: this job's own
library is typically a few hundred to a few thousand performers, not
660k, and unlike the backfill this runs *inside* a long-lived service
process's shared event loop, not a one-shot batch container -- the main
coordinator loop below is async and never blocks synchronously, so other
requests/jobs keep running while this one is in flight.

`LocalPerformerIndex.upsert()`/`remove()` touch a usearch C++ Index
object and are not thread-safe, so exactly one thread (the main
coordinator, i.e. this job's own `run()`) ever calls them -- the async
fetch stage only ever *reads* `index.get_image_hash()` (a plain dict
lookup, safe under the GIL, and it never touches the usearch Index
object at all), and reports anything requiring a write back to the
coordinator via a queue instead of writing it itself.

Uses `sync_one_performer()`'s pure helpers (`_image_fingerprint`,
`_relative_image_url`, `STASHDB_ENDPOINT`) but not the function itself --
`sync_one_performer()` stays untouched since the single-performer Stash
hook handler also depends on its exact current (simple, sequential)
behavior.
