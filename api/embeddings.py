"""Face detection and embedding generation.

buffalo_l migration: replaces the legacy RetinaFace(buffalo_sc)+FaceNet512+
ArcFace dual pipeline with InsightFace's `buffalo_l` bundle (SCRFD-10GF
detection + ResNet50@WebFace600K recognition), one embedding per face.
Mirrors stash-sense2-data-gen's own embeddings.py exactly (same
`FaceAnalysis(name="buffalo_l", allowed_modules=["detection","recognition"])`
call, same normed_embedding output) -- the sidecar's query-time embeddings
and the database's stored embeddings MUST come from the identical code
path, or matching would be silently, systematically wrong. Deliberately
NOT reimplemented as a standalone ONNX session fed a pre-cropped face image
(the way the legacy FaceNet512/ArcFace models were): InsightFace's own
recognition wrapper expects the *original* image + landmarks and does its
own internal alignment/preprocessing (channel order, normalization) that
isn't safe to reverse-engineer and re-implement by hand -- getting that
wrong would produce embeddings that are subtly, silently incompatible with
what the database actually contains. Detection and embedding therefore
happen together in `detect_faces()`; `get_embeddings_batch()`/
`get_embedding()` just read back what was already computed, on
`DetectedFace` objects (not raw crop arrays -- every caller in this
codebase already calls `detect_faces()` immediately before embedding the
same image, so this isn't a behavior change for any of them, just a
signature change: pass the DetectedFace, not `.image`).

All inference runs through ONNX Runtime with GPU acceleration when
available (CUDA or ROCm/MIGraphX, see Dockerfile.rocm/Dockerfile.cuda),
falling back to CPU.

# in one pass, a tight head-only selection didn't). A second pass on that
# same photo (measuring/correcting the new -49 degree residual) converged
# to +5 degrees. Iterating up to this many times before giving up handles
